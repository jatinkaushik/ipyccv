You might notice that what you did, by concatenating a part of the image  to the rest of it in a different place, you could also directly do to the image without multiplying with an identity. This is completely true and you could have done this. However, a neat trick from linear algebra allows us utilize the identity matrix for more than just shifting the image up or down. Try changing the order of the multiplication to (`img*eye`). What did the multiplication do? \n",
