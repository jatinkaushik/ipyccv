    "Hello, welcome to the first tutorial of the CLPS1520 Computational Vision class. My name is Michele, and I'll be going over some useful Matlab functions today. Unlike most other languages, Matlab is unique in that it has a dedicated function for pretty much anything.  Powerful and complex computations can be done efficiently in short lines if you know what you're doing. The goal of these tutorials is to give you experience with some of the functions that we feel would be useful in completing the modeling assignments, as well as to give you more practice if the language is new for you."

The Exercises section goes over some examples of image manipulation and filtering (which be covered in Tutorial 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "In computational vision, we'll be working often with images, which can be represented in many different ways. Some good references for Matlab documentation on the different types of images can be found here: http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_plots/image-types.html, http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/image-types-in-the-toolbox.html#f14-17587. This documentation goes over indexed images, intensity (grayscale), and RGB (truecolor) images. Briefly, indexed images have a data matrix and a colormap matrix that contains floating point numbers between 0 and 1. Each value in the data matrix represents a pixel in the image, and corresponds to a row in the colormap matrix, and each column in that row represents the red, green, or blue components of the pixel. Intensity (grayscale) images have a data matrix that stores values of pixel intensities. RGB (truecolor) images are m x n x 3 matrices that define the red, blue, and green components of each pixel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today we'll be working with images that have pixel intensities between 0 and 255 (images with 8-bit integers). The numbering convention is from early days of computing, when computers had little memory. Information was stored using 8-bit integers, with 255 as the largest integer. Today, this limit has been surpassed, and so you can store images in a plethora of formats/scales. You can read this Matlab documentation on the supported classes for images: http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_plots/working-with-8-bit-and-16-bit-images.html. \n",
    "\n",
    "It goes over 8-bit, and 16-bit images, as well as the necessity of double precision. Some Matlab functions require integer inputs (8-bit and 16-bit), or double precision (Matlab default). You can convert integer inputs to double precision and vice versa by:\n",
    "> `double(image);`\n",
    "\n",
    "> `uint8(image);`\n",
    "\n",
    "> `uint16(image);`\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if you don't understand what `double` does yet, just be aware of it and remember that some functions require it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to human vision, most people see in varying ranges of color, which relies on more stored information per pixel than grayscale. Let's first start with loading a color image into our Matlab workspace. We will use the imread function to do this. Use `imread` on 'circle.png' and save it as the variable `circle`."
