    "Hi everybody, welcome to the third tutorial of CLPS 1520: Computational Vision.  My name is Denise, and today, we’ll be building on previous tutorials with basic computing concepts. We will also go over tips for completing this assignment.\n",

    "First, let’s talk about multidimensional arrays.  By now, you should have become familiar with one dimensional vectors, two dimensional arrays or matrixes with rows and columns (grayscale images for instance), and three dimensional arrays (color images for instance).  So far, it’s easy to visualize these arrays since we recognize the third dimension as color.  Below, I have read in ``saturn.png`` and shown the photo in one figure, then the photo’s RGB color channels in another figure.  You can just reference ``‘saturn.png’`` because it is one of Matlab’s builtin demo images. More demo images can be found in the ``‘\\toolbox\\images\\imdata`` directory."

Try indexing into ``F`` with ``(:,:,n)`` where ``n`` is any number corresponding to the slice you want from ``F`` and visualizing it with ``imagesc()``.
