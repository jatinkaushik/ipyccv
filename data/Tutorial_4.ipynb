    "We can do this by using the function **`padarray`** which takes in `(array, [num num], padval)`. The `[num num]` is the padsize. For example, a padsize of `[1 5]` would add 1 element of padding on the first dimension, and 5 elements of padding on the second. The third parameter, `padval`, specifies the value with which to pad the input array. If you do not input a value for `padval`, `padarray` will default to padding wtih 0.. \n",
