# This script queues an ipython notebook server or returns its status if it is already queued
# When started without parameters, the script will output a single line starting with JOB:
# JOB OFF                                - No job found. A new ipython job will be started.
# JOB QUEUED <reason> <est. start>       - iPython notebook job has been queued but no node allocated yet. 
# JOB INIT <node> <jobid> <rem time>     - The job has been starting on <node> but the process is still initializing.
# JOB RUNNING <node> <port> <jobid> <rem time> <password>   - The notebook is running on node <node> and port <port>. <rem time> is the remaining time until it will be killed.
# 
# Usage: nbsched.sh package [command]
# The package should have a corresponding setup script in data
# Commands:
#  START  - this script will launch a jupyter notebook directly
#  KILL   - kill any previously started notebook
# Output logs are created in subfolder logs/
