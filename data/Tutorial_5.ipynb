    "Hello everyone, and welcome back to Tutorial 5! My name is Michele and we’re going to dive into MatConvNet today and get some basic practice with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "###### Intro to Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, we’ll be using **MatConvNet, a Matlab toolbox that allows us to implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).** Instructions on how to download and compile MatConvNet locally have been provided in the Assignment 3 instructions. Some of you will have to download Xcode for MacOSX, which will allow you to compile MatConvNet. It can be found here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12. For Windows, you may have to download Visual Studio 13 Community, which can be found here: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691978&clcid=0x409. MatConvNet has already been compiled as a module for CPU and GPU on CCV, so all we have to do is call upon which module we would like to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This tutorial will be run using the CPU compiled version of MatConvNet, to make running this tutorial locally on your laptop more feasible.** However, for the actual assignment, you are welcome to use the GPU compiled MatConvNet provided in CCV. We will also go over some basic GPU programming in Matlab, to show you the benchmarks between CPU and GPU processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "###### Background: CPU vs GPU:\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve seen me throw around the acronyms CPU and GPU, but what do they mean? CPU means central processing unit and GPU means graphics processing unit (also known as a VPU or visual processing unit). Your CPU is the processor that your computer has running on it (currently, it’s name probably includes “i5” or “i7” along with an “inspiron” or something like that), and it allows you computer to compute and run programs. Traditionally, the speed of your CPU is maxed by the speed at which a disk inside of it can spin (usually denoted by a 2.5GHz or similar number). The faster it spins, the more calculations it can do per second, the faster your computer can do things. Your graphics card is your GPU, and it’s what’s telling the pixels in your screen what to do. GPUs can be thought of as many little CPUs, and in our case, they’re useful because we take advantage of the redundancy of calculations in our code. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our use, think of this metaphor: We want to tie bowties. Using a CPU, would be like tying one bowtie after another. This is “serial processing”, doing one thing after another is completed, and the only way to do this faster is to shorten the time that it takes to tie each individual bowtie. Using a GPU, would be like tying five bowties at a time, also called “parallel processing”. In this example, you can see that using a GPU would be faster at solving our problem, because there is an upper limit to how fast we can tie each bowtie, and each step is redundant, it doesn’t matter if we tie bowtie 1 at the same time as bowtie 3 because the tying of bowtie 3 doesn’t depend on how bowtie 1 was tied. A lot of processing follows this redundancy, which is why we can use GPU programming to speed up our code. Of course, CPUs and GPUs are more complex than a simple metaphor about bowties, but this is the extent of what you’ll need to know for this class. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "###### What we’re doing in this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have learned from class, CNNs are Artificial Neural Networks (also known as Multilayer Perceptrons) with architectures inspired by animal visual processing. Today, we’re going to use a pre-trained CNN and load it into the Matlab to look at its structural representation. Hopefully, by the end of this tutorial, you’ll be more comfortable with using the MatConvNet toolbox and working with CNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re going to be using the pretrained model **imagenet-vgg-verydeep-16**, which you can read more about from:  http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556/. It is a CNN trained for large-scale image recognition on the ImageNet data set."
